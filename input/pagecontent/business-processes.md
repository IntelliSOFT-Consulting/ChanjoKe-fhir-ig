A business process, or process, is a set of related activities or tasks performed together to achieve the objectives of the health Programme area, such as registration, counselling and referrals.

Workflows are a visual representation of the progression of activities (tasks, events and interactions) that are performed within the business process. The workflow provides a story for the business process being diagrammed and is used to enhance communication and collaboration among users, stakeholders and engineers.

## Overview of Key Business Processes

This section illustrates the workflows of the identified processes using standardized notations for business process mapping.

### Table: Business process symbols used in workflows
The workflows that follow depict processes that have been generalized across different contexts and may not reflect the variability and nuances across different settings. The simplicity of the workflow may not adequately illustrate the nonlinear steps that may occur.

      <td>A pool consists of multiple “swim lanes” that depict all the individuals or types of users that are involved in carrying out the business process or workflow. Diagrams should be clear, neat and easy for all viewers to understand the relationship across the different swim lanes. For example, a pool would depict the business process of conducting an outreach activity, which involves multiple participants, each stakeholder represented by a different lane in that pool. </td>

      <td>Swim lane </td>
      <td>Each individual or type of user is assigned to a swim lane, a designated area for noting the activities performed or expected of that specific actor. For example, a family planning health worker may have one swim lane; the supervisor would be in another swim lane; the clients/patients would be classified in another swim lane. If the activities can be performed by either actor, then those activities can be depicted overlapping the two relevant swim lanes.</td>

All symbols (except Start event) may have an unlimited number of input arrows. All symbols (except Eend event and the Gateway) should have one and only one output arrow, leading to a new symbol, looping back to a previously used symbol or pointing to the Eend event symbol.

       <p>In this document There should typically be only two different outputs that originate from the decision- point. If you find yourself needing more than two “output” or sequence flow direction arrows, this is you most likely trying to depict “decision-support logic” or a “business rule”.

It is the end of a process on your current page or the end of a sub-process that is part of a larger process.
